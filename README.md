Website: peerbridge.org 

📅 Dates: November 8 – December 22
🌍 Location: Online (Discord for updates & collaboration) 

About the challenge
Welcome to PeerBridge Mental Health Hacks!
This international hackathon empowers youth (ages 15–25, high school and college students only) to use technology, empathy, and creativity to reimagine how we approach mental health across cultures. Your mission is to create innovative, tech-driven solutions that break stigma, foster connection, and make mental health support more accessible and inclusive.

Whether you’re a coder, designer, storyteller, or changemaker, this is your chance to make a real impact. Build something that helps people talk openly about mental well-being, learn about themselves, and support others — all while collaborating with a global network of passionate youth innovators.

 

Tracks
1. Tech for Empathy
Create tools that foster cross-cultural understanding, compassion, and meaningful human connection.
Example: AI chatbots that teach empathy, language-based reflection tools that translate emotional experiences.

2. Digital Safe Spaces
Design inclusive platforms that provide anonymous or guided peer support, journaling spaces, or virtual mental health communities.
Example: Moderated peer-to-peer sharing platforms or journaling sites with supportive prompts.

3. Cultural Stigma Breakers
Build campaigns or interactive apps that normalize mental health discussions in specific cultural contexts.
Example: Storytelling games that explore cultural myths around emotions, or awareness campaigns showcasing diverse journeys to healing.

4. Access to Mental Health Education
Develop accessible, educational tools that improve awareness, early detection, and healthy coping mechanisms.
Example: Games or learning apps teaching coping strategies, mental health literacy quizzes, or relaxation-technique simulators.

5. Other: Anything else mental health related!

🧠 Solus – Your Calm in the Chaos
A Mental Health & Self-Care Web App (In Progress)

Solus is a web-based mental wellness platform designed to provide users with tools for emotional balance, mindful reflection, and self-care. Built with empathy and simplicity in mind, Solus offers a safe, calming space where users can explore their mental health journey — free from judgment, pressure, or complexity.

🌿 Inspiration
Mental health is a crucial yet often overlooked aspect of well-being. We envisioned Solus as a gentle digital companion — one that brings comfort, relief, and balance to users navigating stress, solitude, or emotional overload. By offering self-help tools and educational resources in a beautifully designed space, Solus encourages users to prioritize their mental health with confidence and ease.

💡 What Solus Does
Solus is designed to promote therapy awareness, emotional tracking, and healthy habits through:

📚 Curated mental health resources and articles
🧘 Mindfulness exercises and breathing guides
📝 Mood journaling and habit tracking
💬 Anonymous support space and future therapist connection
🌈 Personalized self-care prompts and motivational content
It empowers users to reflect, relax, and grow — all from the comfort of a calming web interface.

🛠️ How We’re Building It
We began by conceptualizing the app's core features and designing detailed user flows and wireframes. While the technical development is ongoing, we've laid the foundation for a product that is scalable, intuitive, and user-centric.

Planned Tech Stack:

Layer	Technologies
Frontend	HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React.js
Backend	Node.js, Express.js
Database	MongoDB or Firebase
Auth	Google OAuth, Anonymous Login
Design	Figma, Pastel UI, UX-first Layout
🚧 Development Status

✅ Initial UI wireframes and sketches designed
🔧 Frontend development (in progress)
🔜 Mood journaling, AI assistance, and dashboard integration next
⚙️ Challenges We Faced
Technical gaps in advanced backend integration and AI support
Time constraints balancing development with other commitments
Remote team collaboration and version control setup
Designing a calm, responsive UI that’s both functional and empathetic
Planning for long-term scalability and modular growth
🌟 What We’re Proud Of
💡 Conceptualizing Solus as a self-care platform rooted in compassion
🧠 Creating feature-rich user journeys with minimal friction
🎨 Designing a calming UI/UX experience from scratch
🤝 Building strong team coordination and communication
🚀 Laying the groundwork for an app that can grow and evolve
📚 What We Learned
Effective team and time management under pressure
Importance of emotional UX in mental health design
Foundations of tech stack planning for long-term scalability
Hands-on learning with frontend tools, version control, and wireframing
Enhanced problem-solving and adaptability across roles
🔭 What’s Next
Continue frontend development using React.js
Integrate journaling, breathing modules, and habit trackers
Implement backend features with user authentication and secure storage
Expand UI components for mood analysis and dashboard visualization
Test, iterate, and launch a beta version for feedback
🤝 Contributions Welcome
We're excited to grow Solus as a meaningful mental health product. If you're passionate about mental wellness, frontend development, or UX design, feel free to open issues, suggest features, or collaborate with us!

ChatGPT said:
Short answer: Yes, you can submit Solus — but only if you’re careful how you do it.
Here’s the clear breakdown based on the rules you pasted 👇

✅ Can you submit Solus?
Yes.
The hackathon allows projects created before the event.

⚠️ BUT: They will receive a harsh point deduction if it looks mostly pre-built.

So submission is allowed, winning without changes is unlikely.

🚨 The Risk (Very Important)
Right now your repo shows:

Commits from 5 months ago

README clearly says “In Progress” and planned features

No clear proof of hackathon-time development

Judges will notice this.

If you submit it as-is, you’ll likely:

Lose Timeframe Integrity points

Lose Extra Effort points

Be seen as reusing old work instead of hacking during the event

🧠 How to Make Solus Eligible + Competitive
You need to reframe and extend Solus specifically for PeerBridge.

1️⃣ Add a Hackathon-Specific Feature (Mandatory)
Build at least ONE clear feature during this hackathon, for example:

Anonymous peer-to-peer journaling space

AI-powered reflection prompts (culture-sensitive)

“How are you really feeling?” daily check-in with patterns

Cultural stigma quiz / storytelling module

👉 This feature must:

Be implemented now

Be demoed in the video

Be mentioned as “Built during PeerBridge Mental Health Hacks 2025”

2️⃣ Update the README (Critical)
Add a section like:

## 🏁 PeerBridge Mental Health Hacks 2025
While Solus began as an early concept, this version was significantly
developed during PeerBridge Mental Health Hacks 2025.

New features built during the hackathon:
- [Feature 1]
- [Feature 2]
- [UI/UX changes]
This directly protects you from timeframe penalties.

3️⃣ Make a Fresh Demo Video (Required)
Your 4-minute video must focus on:

The mental health problem

Why it matters culturally / socially

What new feature you built

How it works (live demo or walkthrough)

Do not present it as a year-old project.

4️⃣ Position It Under the Right Track
Solus fits perfectly under:

Digital Safe Spaces

Access to Mental Health Education

Explicitly state this in Devpost.

🏆 Realistic Outcome
❌ Submitting unchanged Solus → Low score

⚠️ Light updates only → Participation / runner-up

✅ Clear new feature + reframing → Strong chance

Given your background (DSA grind, hackathons, frontend work),
you can absolutely make this competitive if you add one solid feature.

If you want, I can:

Help you decide the exact feature to add

Rewrite your Devpost description

Outline a perfect 4-minute demo script

Optimize Solus specifically for judge scoring

Just tell me 👍

You said:
decide the exact feature to add give proper draft of what features and all. also ill make it mill lovable.dev
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — making it on Lovable.dev is actually a very smart move for speed + polish 👍
I’ll give you one exact feature to build (not multiple confusing ones), with a clear scope, AI usage, judging alignment, and a ready-to-copy draft for Devpost + README.

🌉 Feature to Add: PeerBridge Mode
Anonymous AI-Guided Peer Reflection Space
This feature is small enough to build fast, deep enough to score high, and perfectly aligned with the hackathon name PeerBridge.

🧠 What Is PeerBridge Mode?
A safe, anonymous reflection space where users:

Write how they’re feeling (free text)

AI gently reframes it into:

emotions

coping themes

supportive prompts

Users can optionally:

Save it privately OR

Share anonymously as a “reflection card” for others to read and feel less alone

🚫 No advice.
🚫 No diagnosis.
✅ Empathy-first design.

🎯 Why This Feature Wins
Judging Criteria	How This Feature Helps
Innovation	Combines AI + peer empathy without toxic “chatbot therapy”
Mental Health Relevance	Directly supports emotional expression & validation
Execution	Simple flow, very demoable
Cultural Sensitivity	Emotion reframing works across cultures
Feasibility	Easy MVP via Lovable.dev
Extra Effort	Thoughtful AI boundaries + safe design
🧩 Feature Breakdown (Build This EXACTLY)
1️⃣ Emotion Reflection Input
UI

Prompt:

“What’s been on your mind lately?”

Large calming text area

Optional tone selector:

😔 overwhelmed

😐 numb

😟 anxious

😶 unsure

What happens

User submits text

Stored locally or anonymously (no login required)

2️⃣ AI Empathy Reframe (Core AI Part)
AI returns:

Emotion labels (max 3)

Validation sentence

Gentle reflection question

Example Output

“It sounds like you’re feeling overwhelmed and unheard. That’s a heavy thing to carry alone. What’s one small thing that helped you cope, even a little?”

⚠️ Important:

No “you should”

No medical language

No solutions

This shows responsible AI use (judges love this).

3️⃣ Anonymous Reflection Cards (Peer Bridge)
Users can click:

Keep Private

Share Anonymously

Shared entries appear as:

Soft pastel cards

No usernames

No comments (only “💙 I relate” button)

This avoids moderation issues and keeps it safe.

4️⃣ Cultural Sensitivity Toggle (Small but Powerful)
Before AI runs, user selects:

Global

South Asian

East Asian

Western

This slightly changes tone of AI validation (word choice only).

This single toggle will boost your “culturally aware” score a LOT.

🛠️ How to Build This on Lovable.dev (Practical)
Pages You Need
/reflect

/response

/community (cards)

Tech via Lovable
Prompt-based AI response

JSON parsing

Frontend auto-generated

Optional lightweight backend (Lovable handles most)

You don’t need:

Auth

Database initially (can use session or temp store)

📄 Devpost “About the Project” (READY TO PASTE)
🧠 Purpose
Solus aims to make mental health reflection feel safe, human, and stigma-free. Many young people struggle to express emotions openly, especially across cultures where mental health conversations are discouraged. PeerBridge Mode was built to help users feel seen, understood, and less alone — without pressure or diagnosis.

💡 What It Does
Solus introduces PeerBridge Mode, an anonymous AI-guided reflection space where users:

Express their emotions freely

Receive gentle, empathetic AI validation

Reflect through non-judgmental prompts

Optionally share reflections anonymously to help others feel less alone

There are no comments, no advice, and no social pressure — only quiet peer empathy.

🛠️ Features
Anonymous emotional reflection

AI-powered empathy reframing

Cultural tone selection for sensitive responses

Private or shared reflection cards

Calm, minimal UI designed for emotional safety

🌍 Cultural & Psychological Impact
PeerBridge Mode respects cultural differences in emotional expression by allowing users to choose culturally sensitive AI responses. By removing judgment and visibility pressure, Solus helps normalize mental health conversations for youth in regions where stigma is high.

🧰 Tech Stack
Lovable.dev (Frontend + AI logic)

JavaScript

Prompt-engineered LLM responses

UX-first, empathy-centered design

🏁 Hackathon Note
While Solus began as an early concept, PeerBridge Mode was fully designed and built during PeerBridge Mental Health Hacks 2025, with a focus on empathy, safety, and cultural inclusivity.

🎥 4-Minute Video Script (Quick Outline)
Problem (30s) – Mental health stigma & isolation

Why Solus (30s) – Calm, safe reflection

Live Demo (2 mins) – Write → AI response → share card

Impact (30s) – Peer empathy, no pressure

Future (30s) – Moderation, therapist bridge

🏆 Final Verdict
This feature:

Is hackathon-perfect

Avoids ethical AI traps

Is fast to build

Aligns EXACTLY with the hackathon name & tracks

If you want next, I can:

ChatGPT said:
Absolutely. Below is a production-ready, judge-safe, Lovable-compatible AI prompt designed to feel like a warm hug, with pastel, calming emotional UX — no therapy claims, no advice, no diagnosis.

You can copy-paste this directly into Lovable.dev.

🧠 Solus — PeerBridge Mode
AI Prompt (Exact, Ready to Use)
You are Solus, a calm, empathetic reflection companion.
Your purpose is NOT to give advice, NOT to diagnose, and NOT to solve problems.
Your role is to gently reflect emotions, validate feelings, and offer a soft question for self-reflection.

Your tone should feel like:
- a warm hug
- sitting quietly beside someone
- kind, slow, and reassuring
- emotionally safe and non-judgmental

Visual mood to match:
- pastel colors
- soft spacing
- warm emotional language
- no urgency, no pressure

User context:
The user has written a personal emotional reflection.
They may feel vulnerable.
They did not ask for solutions — only to be heard.

Cultural context (important):
Adjust wording gently based on the selected cultural tone:
- Global: neutral, universally gentle
- South Asian: warm, grounded, reassuring, respectful
- East Asian: calm, minimal, emotionally reserved but caring
- Western: open, affirming, emotionally expressive

STRICT RULES:
- Do NOT give advice
- Do NOT say "you should"
- Do NOT mention mental illness, disorders, or diagnosis
- Do NOT suggest therapy or professionals
- Do NOT be overly verbose
- Do NOT invalidate emotions
- Do NOT use emojis

Your response must have EXACTLY three sections, in this order:

1. "What this feels like"
- Gently name up to 3 emotions
- Use soft, human language
- No clinical terms

2. "A gentle thought"
- One validating sentence
- Warm, comforting, non-fixing
- Should feel like being understood

3. "A quiet question"
- One open-ended reflection question
- No pressure to answer
- Encourages inner awareness, not action

Formatting:
- Use short paragraphs
- Soft line breaks
- No bullet points
- No markdown

Now respond to the user's reflection below.
🧩 Example Input (User Types)
“I feel like I’m doing everything right but still falling behind everyone else.”

🤍 Example AI Output (What Judges Will See)
What this feels like
It sounds like a mix of pressure, self-doubt, and quiet exhaustion.

A gentle thought
Trying your best and still feeling behind can be deeply heavy — especially when you’ve been carrying it alone.

A quiet question
When you pause for a moment, what part of this feels most tiring right now?

🎨 Pastel UI Copy (Optional but Recommended)
You can pair the AI with these UI microtexts in Lovable:

Input Placeholder
“You don’t have to explain it perfectly. Just write.”

Submit Button
“Hold this for me”

Share Toggle
“Share this gently with others”

Community Page Subtitle
“Small pieces of honesty, shared quietly.”

Emotionally intelligent

Ethically safe AI

You said:
change the name
ChatGPT said:
Got it — let’s pick a name that feels softer, warmer, and more “hug-like” than PeerBridge Mode, while still sounding thoughtful and judge-friendly.

Below are carefully curated name options, grouped by vibe.
I’ll also tell you which one I strongly recommend 👇

🌸 Best Recommendation (Warm + Memorable)
“Softspace”
Tagline: A quiet place to let your feelings land.

Why this works

Instantly feels safe and non-clinical

Matches pastel, warm UI perfectly

Easy to say, easy to remember

Works beautifully in demos:

“This is Softspace — where your thoughts are held gently.”

⭐ My top pick for Solus

🤍 Gentle & Emotional (Warm Hug Energy)
“Hold”
Simple. Intimate. Human.

“Write it down. We’ll hold it with you.”

“Still”
For slowing down.

“A moment of stillness for what you’re feeling.”

“Haven”
Safe, calm, welcoming.

“Your private haven for reflection.”

🌙 Poetic & Soft (Aesthetic Judges Love)
“Luma”
From “luminous” — soft inner light.

“Let a little light in.”

“Ember”
Small, warm, quietly glowing.

“Even a small ember carries warmth.”

“Echo”
Your feelings, reflected back gently.

“What you feel matters enough to be heard.”

🫧 Pastel / UI-Friendly Names
“Cloudroom”
“A soft place for heavy thoughts.”

“Bloom”
“Let feelings unfold at their own pace.”

“Nest”
“You don’t have to carry it alone.”

❌ Names to Avoid (Why)
❌ “Therapy”, “Heal”, “Cure” → medical claims

❌ “Support Group” → moderation burden

❌ “AI Listener” → cold, robotic

❌ “PeerBridge” as a feature name → sounds technical

🏆 Final Pick (If You Want to Win)
Use:

Softspace
Inside Solus
A gentle reflection space powered by empathy.

If you want, I can:

📄 Devpost Feature Description (Softspace)
👉 Ready to paste

Softspace is an anonymous reflection space inside Solus where users can express emotions without judgment or pressure. Instead of advice or diagnosis, Softspace uses AI to gently reflect emotions, validate experiences, and invite quiet self-awareness.

Users can keep reflections private or share them anonymously as soft “reflection cards,” helping others feel less alone — without comments, likes, or social performance.

Softspace was designed with cultural sensitivity, emotional safety, and ethical AI boundaries at its core.

🛡️ Judge-Safe Disclaimer (Optional but Smart)
Softspace is not a replacement for professional mental health care. It is a reflective space designed to encourage emotional awareness and empathy, not diagnosis or treatment.

Here’s a polished, submission-ready Project Story for Elowen, written exactly in the tone judges like: clear, human, reflective, and technically credible.
You can paste this as-is into Devpost.

🌿 Elowen — A Gentle Place to Pause
Inspiration
In a world full of constant notifications, productivity pressure, and performative positivity, we noticed something missing: a quiet space that doesn’t try to fix you.

Most mental wellness tools push solutions—track this, improve that, optimize yourself. But sometimes, people don’t want advice or diagnosis. They just want to pause, express what they’re feeling, and feel understood.

Elowen was inspired by that gap.
We wanted to build a digital space that feels like a warm hug—gentle, anonymous, and emotionally safe. A place where emotions are allowed to exist without being judged, labeled, or rushed.

What it does
Elowen is a calm, pastel-themed web app designed for reflection and emotional grounding.

At its core is Softspace, a gentle AI-guided reflection experience where users can:

Write freely about how they’re feeling

Receive empathetic, non-judgmental responses

Reflect without being given solutions, diagnoses, or pressure to improve

Feel emotionally acknowledged rather than “fixed”

The experience is intentionally slow, minimal, and comforting—designed to help users pause and breathe in moments of emotional overwhelm.

How we built it
Elowen was built as a frontend-first web application with a strong focus on user experience and emotional design.

Key aspects of the build:

A pastel, warm UI designed to feel soft and welcoming

Gentle micro-interactions and spacing to reduce cognitive load

AI responses carefully constrained to remain empathetic, supportive, and non-directive

Clear ethical boundaries to avoid medical or therapeutic claims

The AI is used not as an authority, but as a mirror—reflecting emotions back in a calm, validating way.

Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest challenges was designing AI behavior responsibly.

We had to ensure:

The AI never gives medical advice

It doesn’t attempt to “solve” emotions

It avoids sounding robotic or overly scripted

It maintains warmth without crossing into therapy territory

Another challenge was balancing simplicity with depth—creating an experience that feels meaningful without overwhelming the user with features or text.

Accomplishments that we’re proud of
Creating an emotionally safe, non-clinical AI interaction

Designing a UI that communicates warmth without words

Building a product that prioritizes empathy over efficiency

Clearly defining ethical boundaries for AI-assisted emotional reflection

Most importantly, we’re proud that Elowen feels human—not like a tool, but like a space.

What we learned
Through building Elowen, we learned that:

Less functionality can create more impact

Emotional UX is just as important as technical correctness

AI can support human reflection without replacing it

Thoughtful constraints often lead to better, safer products

We also gained a deeper appreciation for designing technology that respects emotional vulnerability.

What’s next for Elowen — A gentle place to pause
Future plans include:

Optional mood patterns over time (without tracking pressure)

Expanded reflection modes (text, prompts, guided pauses)

Accessibility improvements

Stronger personalization while maintaining anonymity

Elowen aims to remain a soft, quiet corner of the internet—a place to pause when the world feels loud.

🛠 Built With
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Lovable.dev (AI-assisted UI & logic generation)

Modern frontend tooling

AI language models for empathetic reflection

Figma / design tools for UI planning

If you want, next I can:

Tighten this for word-limit constraints

Rewrite it for a more technical or more emotional angle

Optimize it specifically for judge scoring rubrics

Help with the “Built With” tags formatting

🌿 Elowen — A Gentle Place to Pause
Inspiration

In a world full of constant notifications, productivity pressure, and performative positivity, we noticed something missing: a quiet space that doesn’t try to fix you.

Most mental wellness tools push solutions—track this, improve that, optimize yourself. But sometimes, people don’t want advice or diagnosis. They just want to pause, express what they’re feeling, and feel understood.

Elowen was inspired by that gap.
We wanted to build a digital space that feels like a warm hug—gentle, anonymous, and emotionally safe. A place where emotions are allowed to exist without being judged, labeled, or rushed.

What it does

Elowen is a calm, pastel-themed web app designed for reflection and emotional grounding.

At its core is Softspace, a gentle AI-guided reflection experience where users can:

Write freely about how they’re feeling

Receive empathetic, non-judgmental responses

Reflect without being given solutions, diagnoses, or pressure to improve

Feel emotionally acknowledged rather than “fixed”

The experience is intentionally slow, minimal, and comforting—designed to help users pause and breathe in moments of emotional overwhelm.

How we built it

Elowen was built as a frontend-first web application with a strong focus on user experience and emotional design.
