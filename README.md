# 🌿 Elowen — A Gentle Place to Pause  
*A Soft, Emotionally Safe Reflection Space Powered by Empathetic AI*

**Elowen** is a calm, pastel-themed web application designed to help people pause, reflect, and feel emotionally acknowledged — without judgment, pressure, or solutions.  
At its heart is **Softspace**, a gentle AI-guided reflection experience that responds with empathy rather than advice, creating a warm, comforting space that feels like a quiet hug.

## 🎯 Project Objective
